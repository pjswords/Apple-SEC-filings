# This script retrieves and parses Apple's annual SEC filings from 2007 
# through 2015. After retrieving a report from Apple's website, the program 
# searches for the section titled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and builds a 
# dictionary from the words in that section. The program then places 
# the contents of the dictionary into an object that corresponds to 
# a Microsoft Excel worksheet. While building the worksheets, the program also
# provides console output showing which words have the highest frequency.
# Once a worksheet is built for each report, the program saves them in a single
# XLSX file that can be used with Tableau.
#
# Note: This script was written for Python 3, and it requires access to the 
# BeautifulSoup, OpenPyXL, and nltk libraries.
